# Interactive-Slideshow
This is an interactive slide show that allows users to view a collection of pictures.
When a user clicks on a picture, a new window opens displaying a zoomed-in version of the image. 
The window also contains a hyperlink (button) that can be clicked to add the picture to a favorites area located at the bottom of the first page. 
The application restricts the number of favorites to a maximum of 5 pictures.
If the user attempts to add more than 5 pictures to the favorites area, a message will be displayed, 
prompting the user to remove at least one favorite before adding another.

In case the user wishes to remove a picture from the favorites, they can click on the Remove link (button) that appears next to the respective picture. 
The application will remove the selected picture from the favorites area.
